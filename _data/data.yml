career-profile:
    title: Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Golang Software / Systems Engineer based in the UK.
      I have spent the majority of my career in cloud computing with more than
      two years as a maintainer of the container runtime for the OSS Cloud Foundry
      PaaS, and one year as a maintainer of the OSS Liquid Metal project.
      I enjoy investigating and designing new systems, and mentoring others to
      be able to do the same. I am dedicated to sharing knowledge with thorough
      documentation and workshops. I am often asked to step into leadership and
      product roles, however I am more interested in IC Platform Engineer roles.
      **I am only open to fully remote opportunities**.

          details: |
            Returning to an IC role, I began on the OSS [eksctl](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl) team. I improved
            the project’s OSS presence, management and documentation. I worked
            closely with industry partners to scope out and develop new features.

            After a year I moved to develop the [Liquid Metal](https://github.com/weaveworks-liquidmetal) project; an OSS
            Kubernetes on bare-metal solution using MicroVMs. I investigated and
            developed new features; experimented with various hardware and network
            configurations (using Equinix Metal and Raspberry Pi); performed demos
            for stakeholders and clients; wrote complete and detailed documentation;
            designed and POC-ed potential use-cases, such as a bare-metal CI/CD
            platform. For a time I was the sole maintainer of the project.

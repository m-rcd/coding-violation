    summary: |
      A backend software engineer looking for a new challenge. In my short career, I have progressed quickly.
      During my time at Smart Pension, I was given lots of different opportunities and challenges and I rose to meet them everytime. In my current role, I started learning front end in order to get more skills.
      I am confident that I can take on more demanding roles at my next company.
      I have worked extensively in Ruby, but am also interested in moving to new languages, for example Go. In my spare time, I contribute to open source projects in Go.

          • As part of a team comprised of  backend, frontend, mobile engineers and design, I worked on implementing push notifications, solving bugs.

          • I helped another team to migrate from Chewy to Searchkick.
          
          • I also picked up a couple of small front end tickets in order to gain a new skill and help my team migrating legacy rails code to next.js.

          While at Smart Pension, I have been rotated through several teams, each bringing new challenges and technologies.
          As I have progressed in my learning, I have also worked ad-hoc to support Principles and Architects, as well as lead and design one-off initiatives for other teams and projects.
          As a Senior, mentoring and leading by example is a large part of my role, and I am always keen to pair with colleagues and document processes so that everyone is brought up to speed.


        roles:
        - title: Junior Software Engineer
          time: Feb 2019 - Jan 2020
          details: |
            **Team 1**

            As part of my first team, I’ve helped build features. I did a lot of code reviews to learn from others and get myself acquainted with the new codebase. Shortly after joining, I led a new feature from design to production which involved writing up tech design documents, breaking it down into tickets and leading refinement sessions.

          time: Jan 2020 - Aug 2021

            **Team 2**

            This team was formed by joining my first team and another team to deliver a big feature with a deadline.
            I was responsible for prioritising the order of work, and separating essential from “could be done later”.
             I assumed the lead on a key piece of the design and implementation, and saw it through into production.
             My other overarching goal was to ensure we met our deadline without introducing excessive technical debt.

             **Side Project 1: Architecture**

             I wanted more exposure to design and architectural practices. I spoke to the head of the architectural team and offered to pick up any work for them.
             They asked me to write an architectural document for implementing a maintenance page using cloudflare, S3 and terraform.
             I was then invited to join the Architecture team, but declined as I had also been requested by another team which also presented an interesting learning opportunity.

            **Team 3**

            As part of this team, I worked on the modularisation of a major part of the monolithic application with the aim of moving it to its own service.
            I introduced a new process to help speed up the code review process which has since been adopted by a few other teams in the company.
            As the most senior engineer of my team, I became the primary source of knowledge.
            I made sure to prioritise documentation to share my knowledge and help new joiners understand the product faster.
            I worked closely with the product owner and finance teams to fix some erroneous data in the platform that could have caused a significant outage.

            **Side Project 2**

            I was asked to work alongside a principal engineer on a side project to automate the process of bumping a gem version.
            I wrote a technical design suggesting a couple of approaches and added my recommendation on which approach to follow and the steps to implement it.


            **Side Project 3**

            I worked with a principal engineer to automate the process of creating and sharing anonymised databases to developers.
            3 weeks into the project, based on research that I undertook, we decided that the project was not cost-effective and therefore recommended that it be terminated.


            **Side Project 4**

            I am currently working on another side project, as requested by a principal engineer, to create a tool that would help make a step of the code review process easier for engineers.
